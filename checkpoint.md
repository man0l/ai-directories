## Directory Database (`directories.json`)

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| **Total entries** | 827 |
| Active | 489 |
| Not found | 162 |
| Domain dead | 64 |
| Timeout | 30 |
| Cloudflare blocked | 20 |
| Error | 32 |
| Invalid URL | 12 |
| Facebook group | 11 |
| Domain parked | 7 |

### Auth Type Breakdown (all 827)

| Auth Type | Count |
|---|---|
| unknown | 308 |
| none (open submit) | 296 |
| google_only | 142 |
| email_password | 36 |
| facebook | 22 |
| google_and_email | 14 |
| other combos | 9 |

### Data Sources
1. Original dataset — 388 entries
2. [sergiuchiriac/ai-directories](https://github.com/sergiuchiriac/ai-directories) — 209 parsed, 47 duplicates skipped, **162 new** added
3. Curated AI directory lists + SaaS aggregators + web directories — **50 new** added (Feb 16)
4. [best-of-ai/ai-directories](https://github.com/best-of-ai/ai-directories) (714★) — 155 parsed, 28 duplicates skipped, **127 new** added (Feb 16)
5. [FutureGenApps directory submission sites](https://www.futuregenapps.com/directory-submission-sites-list) — 219 parsed, 15 dupes, 104 low-DA skipped, **100 new** added (DA≥30, Feb 16)

---

## Submission Plan (`submission_plan.json`)

**Target:** All active directories with `auth_type = none` (173) + `auth_type = email_password` (19) = **192 total**

### Discovery Status

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| **discovered** (form fields found) | 116 |
| **no_form_found** | 28 |
| **timeout** | 48 |

### Best Candidates for Auto-Submit

**45 directories** have forms with >= 2 fields AND no captcha. These are the easiest to automate.

### Copy Variations

30 unique title/description pairs stored in `submission_plan.json`, rotated across all 192 directories.

### Credentials

Configure credentials in `submission_plan.json` under each entry's `credentials` block and in `submit_directories.py` PRODUCT dict. Fields:

| Field | Placeholder |
|---|---|
| Email | `YOUR_EMAIL` |
| Name | `YOUR_NAME` |
| Username | `YOUR_USERNAME` |
| Password | `YOUR_PASSWORD` |

Search for `YOUR_` placeholders and replace with your actual values before running.

## Pipeline Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `analyze_directories.py` | HTTP-level analysis (auth, captcha, pricing, dead domains). ThreadPoolExecutor. |
| `cleanup_and_categorize.py` | Triage errors, build `browser_check_list.json` for Playwright pass. |
| `browser_verify.py` | Async Playwright, 10 workers. `--recheck-unknown` for deep DOM pass on active unknowns. |
| `discover_forms.py` | Async Playwright, 10 workers. Visits submission URLs, extracts form fields via DOM queries. Updates `submission_plan.json`. |
| `submit_directories.py` | Async Playwright, 5 workers. Heuristic field mapping + file uploads. Reads `submission_plan.json`. |

All scripts use `.venv/bin/python` and are idempotent.

---

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `directories.json` | Master database — 827 entries with auth, captcha, status, etc. |
| `submission_plan.json` | 318 submission targets with copy, form fields, form paths, status. |
| `browser_check_list.json` | Intermediate — sites needing browser verification (generated by cleanup script). |
| `checkpoint.md` | This file — project state snapshot. |

---

## Submission Results

**Script:** `submit_directories.py` — Async Playwright, 5 workers, heuristic field mapping, file uploads for logo/screenshot.

| Status | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **submitted** | 71 | Form filled + submit button clicked |
| **timeout** | 40 | From discovery phase (never got forms) |
| **no_fields_matched** | 34 | Page had forms but fields didn't match product data patterns |
| **no_form_found** | 28 | No forms found on the page at all |
| **discovered** | 14 | Forms found but not attempted (search-only / trivial) |
| **submit_timeout** | 4 | Timed out during submission attempt |
| **filled_no_submit** | 1 | Fields filled but no submit button found |

### Assets Used

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `site-image.png` | Product screenshot (viewport capture) |
| `logo.png` | Product logo (nav element crop) |

## Captcha Directories — Manual Submission Required

Directories with captcha require manual browser interaction. Across two batches:

**Batch 1 (5 sites):** 4 submitted, 1 blocked (broken captcha).
**Batch 2 (10 sites):** 5 submitted, 1 timeout, 4 skipped (not real directory forms).

---

## Timeout Retry Results

Retried the 40 `timeout` entries with a fresh pass:

- **4 submitted** (forms worked on retry)
- **5 skipped** (paid-only, not product directories, or login-gated)
- **3 captcha pending** (form filled but captcha unsolved)
- **28 handled total**, 12 timeout entries remained

---

## Updated Submission Plan Summary (318 entries)

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| **submitted** | 66 |
| **skipped** | 94 |
| **no_form_found** | 40 |
| **no_fields_matched** | 41 |
| **timeout** | 30 |
| **skipped_paid** | 17 |
| **discovered** (forms found, not yet attempted) | 9 |
| **cloudflare_blocked** | 6 |
| **submit_timeout** | 4 |
| **skipped_login_required** | 3 |
| **domain_parked** | 2 |
| **other** (captcha, deferred, errors) | 6 |

## Manual Browser Submissions

Several directories were submitted manually via Playwright browser automation (Google login, form filling, etc.). These include SaaSHub, FutureTools.io, AItools.inc, AI Hunt (partial), and others.

### Directories Tried but Not Viable (Manual)

|---|---|
| Best of AI | Paid ($29) |
| AI Parabellum | Paid ($99/$199) |
| TopTools.ai | No submit form |
| AI-Tools Directory | No submit form |
| StackShare | Not a submission directory |
| EU-Startups | Requires membership/login |
| Sidebar.io | Design newsletter, not directory |
| Jasmine Directory | Paid review fee |
| Alive Directory | Requires reciprocal link + reCAPTCHA |
| SoftwareSuggest | Rejects free email domains (requires business email) |
| Feedough | Submit page 404 |
| Desifounder | Requires login |
| Smart Tools AI | Backend API broken |
| AI Directory (aidirectory.org) | Broken reCAPTCHA |
| Futurepedia | Paid (free tier "sold out") |
| AIWizard | Requires NFT purchase |
| AIToolHunt | Empty/broken page |

## Lessons Learned

### Common Blockers
- **Paid directories**: ~20% of AI directories require payment ($15-$299). Many don't disclose pricing until the submit page.
- **reCAPTCHA / Turnstile**: ~5-10% have captchas; some are broken (invalid site keys).
- **Login-gated**: Many require account creation before submission. Google OAuth is common.
- **Business email required**: Some (SoftwareSuggest) reject free email domains (gmail, yahoo).
- **Reciprocal links**: Older web directories require you to link back to them first.
- **NFT / crypto gates**: A few require purchasing tokens/NFTs.
- **Backlink requirements**: Some AI directories check if you link back before listing.
- **Newsletter-only forms**: Many pages that look like submission forms are actually newsletter signups.

### Automation Success Factors
- Directories with simple HTML forms (no JS frameworks) have highest auto-submit success.
- reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible) sometimes passes automatically; v2 (checkbox) never does.
- Google Forms are reliably automatable.
- Rich text editors (TinyMCE, Quill) need special handling.
- Cloudinary/custom upload widgets often break automation.
- Cross-origin Google OAuth popups need tab-switching logic.

### Best ROI Directories (Free, No Captcha, Real Forms)
AI-specific directories with simple forms: FutureTools.io, SaaSHub, AItools.inc, ToolScout AI, Open Future AI, AI Respo, AINave, NoCodeList, NoCodeDevs.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify high-confidence submissions** — Check ~20 top submissions actually landed (not newsletter signups).
2. **Retry 30 timeout entries** — Many are slow-loading general directories.
3. **Manual submit to no_fields_matched** — 41 pages had forms but heuristic mapping didn't match.
4. **Handle 9 discovered but not submitted** — Forms found but not yet attempted.
5. **Handle no_form_found** — 40 entries with JS SPAs or non-standard UIs.
6. **Paid directories** — Several require payment ($15-$299) for listing.
7. **Monitor GitHub PRs** — Check merge status on the 5 PRs created.
